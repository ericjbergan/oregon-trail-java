# oregon-trail-java
First, many thanks to Ian Gregor for his input on how to improve my code. It did already work, but it was much
improved by implementing his suggestions. Plus, they gave me a couple of ideas for my own improvements.

After hearing about someone else converting some old Basic code to Java, I decided to do my own version. As of 
today, 2/8/23, it works fairly well, but isn't quite finished. I still have some tweaking to do and bugs to fix 
and, if I'm going eventually call it complete, I have a lot of tests to write.

I did my best to follow the logic of the original. It was a challenge to follow the flow of the Basic since it is,
by necessity, full of goto here and goto there. It was a pleasure to again see a language that I was very good at
back in the day but have not written or even seen in over 35 years.

In the meantime, if you do take the time to try this, please give me some user experience feedback to help 
with my tweaking and bug finding and fixing: ericjbergan@gmail.com.
